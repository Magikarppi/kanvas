# Kanvas

Kanvas is a project management tool from individuals to small and medium-sized companies. With Kanvas, users can seamlessly organize, monitor and lead their projects using modern, visually appealing and easy to use UI. Kanvas helps you and your team to split complex projects into manageable pieces. Kanvas â€“ complex made simple!

At the core of Kanvas is a handy Kanban board that enables users to easily create columns (or lists) and cards (or tasks) and drag and drop them smoothly on the board. In addition to the traditional Kanban-like board, projects can be managed in a list view that offers users a different way to access project tasks arranged in tables, for example in situations where there are dozens of cards in a project.

In addition to project management features, Kanvas offers several features that extend upon other available tools such as Trello. For example, Kanvas has features for truly public projects that can be viewed by every registered user, encouraging collaboration on for example open source software projects. In the future, Kanvas will support many other interesting features, such as job searching, messaging, visualization of project data and so forth.
